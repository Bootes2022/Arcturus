# Arcturus üåå  
*A Cloud-Native Global Accelerator Framework*



## üìå Overview  
**Arcturus** redefines **Global Acceleration (GA)** by dynamically orchestrating low-cost, multi-cloud resources to deliver **high-performance, low-latency, and highly stable networking** ‚Äî all without the constraints of vendor lock-in. Unlike traditional cloud-tied GA solutions, Arcturus achieves **1.7√ó faster acceleration at 71% lower cost** on the forwarding plane, while sustaining over **80% resource efficiency**, significantly boosting both performance and stability at the data plane level. On the scheduling plane, Arcturus *analyzes the heterogeneity of hybrid-cloud infrastructure and the dynamic behavior of acceleration workloads*, and based on these insights, *designs specialized scheduling strategies*. It combines **last-mile scheduling based on Lyapunov optimization** with **mid-mile scheduling formulated as a constrained maximum flow problem**, jointly optimizing acceleration performance and system stability to achieve **Pareto-optimal efficiency** across diverse network conditions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture 
1. **Controller Nodes**: Master nodes that:
   - Aggregate global performance metrics
   - Analyze data and formulate high-level routing decisions
   - Manage configuration distribution to all nodes
   - Coordinate system-wide operations to ensure consistency

2. **Proxy Nodes**: Edge nodes that:
   - Receive and implement controller-distributed forwarding policies
   - ‚Äã‚ÄãExecute localized routing decisions
   - ‚Äã‚ÄãProcess traffic flows with policy enforcement
   - Report real-time performance telemetry to controllers

```bash
wget https://github.com/Lvpcgithub/Arcturus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && \
unzip main.zip && \
mv Arcturus-main Arcturus && \
rm main.zip

cd /Arcturus

# Add execute permissions to all scripts that need to be run (one-time operation)
chmod +x setup_public_env.sh
chmod +x /forwarding/deploy_forwarding.sh
chmod +x /scheduling/deploy_scheduling.sh

# Run common environment setup (e.g., Go, etcd)
./setup_public_env.sh

# If you want deploy forwarding, run forwarding-specific environment setup
./forwarding/deploy_forwarding.sh

# If you want deploy scheduling, run scheduling-specific environment setup
./scheduling/deploy_scheduling.sh
