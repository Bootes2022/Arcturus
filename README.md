## 📌 Overview  
Arcturus revolutionizes **Global Acceleration (GA)** by dynamically orchestrating low-cost, multi-cloud resources to deliver **high-performance, low-latency networking** without vendor lock-in. Unlike traditional cloud-bound GA services, Arcturus achieves **1.7× faster acceleration at 71% lower cost** while maintaining >80% resource efficiency.  

**Ideal for**:  
- Real-time interactive applications (gaming, video conferencing)  
- Cost-sensitive large-scale deployments  
- Multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud environments  

## ✨ Key Features  
| **Feature**               | **Advantage**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multi-Cloud Adaptive**  | Leverages heterogeneous resources across providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)    |
| **Two-Plane Architecture**| Forwarding plane (adaptive proxies) + Scheduling plane (lightweight optimization) |
| **Cost Efficiency**       | Reduces expenses by 71% vs. commercial GA services                            |
| **Scalability**          | Proven at million-RPS workloads with stable QoS                              |
